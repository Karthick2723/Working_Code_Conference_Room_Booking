    <h1>Technical Support:</h1>

         Customer support can be one of the most difficult points of contact to navigate, but it
          can also arguably be
          considered
          the most important.When a customer calls tech support, it’s a sign something has broken
          in the chain of their
          experience with your company.
          This can be due to a mistake on the part of the user, an error by the business or the
          result of a random act of
          chance,
          but it’s likely the person calling is already unhappy with their experience.Since
          customer satisfaction is the
          cornerstone of any successful business venture, it’s vital they receive the help they
          need and leave the interaction feeling valued.
          Customers tend to form stronger memories of negative experiences than of positive ones. This means a negative
          initial impression can have a greater impact than those that
          follow the expected path.
          While this can be damaging for business when the customer can’t be satisfied, turning
          the interaction around and
          showing
          your company is willing to go the extra mile to improve their experience can leave the
          person with a lasting
          memory of
          receiving excellent service from your representatives.When their story is shared with
          people in their circle or
          on social media, it will end with a win for your business,
          creating positive organic marketing that shows your commitment to consumer satisfaction
          and possibly resulting
          in new
          customers.To get this result, however, there are a number of best practices your company
          needs to follow.
